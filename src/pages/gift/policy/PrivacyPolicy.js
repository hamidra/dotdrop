                    Users have given their consent for one or more specific

                    be allowed to process Personal Data until the User objects

                  <li>
                    processing is related to a task that is carried out in the

                    processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate

              The Controller will retain Personal Data for as long as it is
              required to deliver the Services described in Sections III.A above
              and X.B below, and/or, upon termination, as long as required by
              law or regulations (e.g. mandatory retention periods), whichever
              is longer.

                Personal Data collected for the purposes of the Controller's

              Users may exercise certain rights regarding their Personal Data
              processed by the Controller.
            </p>
            <p>In particular, Users have the right to do the following:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Withdraw their consent at any time. Users have the right to
                withdraw consent where they have previously given their consent
                to the processing of their Personal Data. Please note that even
                after you have chosen to withdraw your consent, we may be able
                to continue to process your Personal Data to the extent required
                or permitted by law.
              </li>
              <li>
                Object to processing of their data. Users have the right to
                object to the processing of their data if the processing is
                carried out on a legal basis other than consent (e.g. for a
                public interest, in the exercise of an official authority vested
                in the Controller or for the purpose of legitimate interests
                pursued by the Controller). Users may object to such processing
                by providing a ground related to their particular situation to
                justify the objection. In particular, under and to the extent of
                a scope of application of the GDPR, in those cases where we base
                processing on our legitimate interests, you have the right to
                object to the processing. Users must know that, however, should
                their Personal Data be processed for direct marketing purposes,
                they can object to that processing at any time without providing
                any justification.
              </li>
              <li>
                Access their data. Users have the right to learn if the
                Controller is processing data, obtain disclosure regrading
                certain aspects of the processing and obtain a copy of the data
                undergoing processing.
              </li>
              <li>
                Verify and seek rectification. Users have the right to verify
                the accuracy of their data and ask for it to be updated or
                corrected. Please note that you must advise us of any changes to
                your personal information so that we can ensure that your
                personal information is accurate and up to date.
              </li>
              <li>
                Restrict the processing of their data. Users have the right,
                under certain circumstances, to restrict the processing of their
                data if the accuracy of the data is disputed. In this case, the
                Controller will not process their data for any purpose other
                than storing it.
              </li>
              <li>
                Restrict the use of Personal Data whilst complaints are
                resolved.
              </li>
              <li>
                Have their Personal Data deleted or otherwise removed.
                <br />
                Users have the right, under certain circumstances, to obtain the
                erasure of their data from the Controller, unless the processing
                is justified by our legitimate interests, necessary to fulfil a
                legal obligation, for reasons of public interest or to assert,
                exercise or defend legal claims. We will take reasonable steps
                to inform other controllers that are processing the data that
                you have requested the erasure of any links to, copies or
                replication of it.
              </li>
              <li>
                Receive their data and have it transferred to another
                controller. Users have the right to receive their data in a
                structured, commonly used and machine readable format and, if
                technically feasible, to have it transmitted to another
                controller without any hindrance. This provision is applicable
                provided that the data is processed by automated means and that
                the processing is based on the User's consent, on a contract
                which the User is part of or on pre-contractual obligations
                thereof.
              </li>
              <li>
                Lodge a complaint. Users have the right to bring a claim before
                their competent data protection authority (depending on your
                country of residence and the applicable data protection laws –
                note that in certain countries you may only notify a data
                protection authority which may then decide to initiate legal
                steps based on its own discretion).

            within the statutory applicable timeframe, unless a delay or a
            retention of the relevant data is permitted by law (e.g. a lack of
            convincing identity proof by an information requestor), is required

                          We also use the web-analysing tool Google Analytics by
                          Google (Google Inc., USA) on our Website to compile
                          anonymous user statistics. Google Analytics uses
                          cookies. To ensure the protection of your personal
                          data, we use a function which processes your IP
                          address in truncated form only in order to prevent a
                          direct personal reference (IP-Anonymization). Your

                          server of Google in the United States. Google is

                          Google Analytics, you may block Google Analytics by
                          installing e.g. a plug-in in your browser. A plug-in
